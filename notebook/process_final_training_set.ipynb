Western music typically sounds polyphonic, meaning more than one layer of melody is being played simultaneously.\\n\\nWestern music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.\\n\\nWestern music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart.

Melodies in middle eastern music are generally long, lack harmony, and have unfamiliar pitches.\\n\\nMiddle Eastern music typically sounds monophonic, meaning it's solely based on one or more instruments that play a single melody with a different variation. Western music typically sounds polyphonic, meaning more than one layer of melody is being played simultaneously.\\n\\nWestern music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.\\n\\nWestern music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart. In contrast, western music has a structure with a beginning, middle, and end.   \n",

It was heard across a wide area partly because it was high up .

After money, the farmer paid the mason, which allowed him to focus on farming without having to know how to build his house . The mason took the money and paid toolmakers who then paid other farmers for their food .

Please explain like I'm five.\\n&lt;bot&gt;: The equipment I believe your referring to is a \" theodolite \", also called a \" total station \" . It it a range / angle finding tool that can measure three different distances (horizontal, vertical, and slope), as well as the two different angles (azimuth, and slope) Imagine a cross - section of a hill where the hypotenuse is the surface of the hill, the length of which is the slope distance; the horizontal distance is the bottom leg of the triangle and the vertical distance is the opposite leg . The theodolite shoots a laser into a passive tool called a \" prism \" that reflects the laser back at it and calculates the distance . The azimuth angle is usually taken from some fixed point due north, and this allows you to find the angles for an entire parcel of land without using a protractor or something equally inaccurate and inefficient . The slope angle is just the angle at which the hill is inclined or declined .

       "9248   <human>: How does a boom from a meteor entering the atmosphere manage to extend across such a wide area? Live in Detroit, and looking for some explanation after I think one broke up in the atmosphere relatively close to us . Explain like I'm five.\\n<bot>: It was loud simply because of the amount of energy a meteor is carrying . It was probably going at least 25000 mph, maybe several times that . It was heard across a wide area partly because it was high up . Additionally, it happened on a cold night, and the temperature gradient in the air (colder air nearer the ground) likely helped bend down sound waves that would have otherwise traveled too far to be heard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Please explain like I'm five.\\n<bot>: Money is probably the greatest economic invention of all time . It lets people get things that they need without actually having to trade for it, and to let people become specialists which accelerated technological advancement . Before money, there were no people who only were masons because they would go hungry since they would have to trade work directly to a farmer for food . After money, the farmer paid the mason, which allowed him to focus on farming without having to know how to build his house . The mason took the money and paid toolmakers who then paid other farmers for their food . Humans being what they are, a moneyless society would break down pretty fast because there would always be slackers who just rely on asking others for help without giving much effort in return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "40199  <human>: What do surveyers do? I see these guys out in the city all the time looking through their equipment like telescopes, but I never knew exactly what they were doing . Please explain like I'm five.\\n<bot>: The equipment I believe your referring to is a \" theodolite \", also called a \" total station \" . It it a range / angle finding tool that can measure three different distances (horizontal, vertical, and slope), as well as the two different angles (azimuth, and slope) Imagine a cross - section of a hill where the hypotenuse is the surface of the hill, the length of which is the slope distance; the horizontal distance is the bottom leg of the triangle and the vertical distance is the opposite leg . The theodolite shoots a laser into a passive tool called a \" prism \" that reflects the laser back at it and calculates the distance . The azimuth angle is usually taken from some fixed point due north, and this allows you to find the angles for an entire parcel of land without using a protractor or something equally inaccurate and inefficient . The slope angle is just the angle at which the hill is inclined or declined . While theodolites are usually the most common method of surveying, the same can be accomplished without such an advanced piece of equipment by using an auto - level and a high rod . The auto - level is appears to be a telescope, but the distinguishing difference is that the auto - level has a series of wire suspended mirrors within the tube that ensure the surveyor only ever looks purely horizontal from wherever they are . This is used in conjunction with a high - rod, a really long stick with markings every inch or so, to determine vertical distance between two points .

       "      <td>&lt;human&gt;: Write me an article about Murabaḥah, ribh Arabic, Islamic jurisprudence, discussing in detail rent-to-own, agreed-upon in four paragraphs. End with a sentence about \" Critics/skeptics, the non-Muslim world.\\n&lt;bot&gt;: Murabaḥah, murabaḥa, or murâbaḥah (Arabic: مرابحة, derived from ribh Arabic: ربح, meaning profit) was originally a term of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) for a sales contract where the buyer and seller agree on the markup (profit) or \\\"cost-plus\\\" price for the item(s) being sold. In recent decades it has become a term for a very common form of Islamic (i.e., \\\"shariah compliant\\\") financing, where the price is marked up in exchange for allowing the buyer to pay over time—for example with monthly payments (a contract with deferred payment being known as bai-muajjal).\\nMurabaha financing is similar to a rent-to-own arrangement in the non-Muslim world, with the intermediary (e.g., the lending bank) retaining ownership of the item being sold until the loan is paid in full. There are also Islamic investment funds and sukuk (Islamic bonds) that use murabahah contracts.\\nThe purpose of murabaha is to finance a purchase without involving interest payments, which most Muslims (particularly most scholars) consider riba (usury) and thus haram (forbidden). Murabaha has come to be \\\"the most prevalent\\\" or \\\"default\\\" type of Islamic finance. A proper murâbaḥah transaction differs from conventional interest-charging loans in several ways. The buyer/borrower pays the seller/lender at an agreed-upon higher price; instead of interest charges, the seller/lender makes a religiously permissible \\\"profit on the sale of goods\\\".\\nThe seller/financer must take actual possession of the good before selling it to the customer, and must assume \\\"any liability from delivering defective goods\\\". Sources differ as to whether the seller is permitted to charge extra when payments are late, with some authors stating any late fees ought to be donated to charity, or not collected unless the buyer has \\\"deliberately refused\\\" to make a payment. For the rate of markup, murabaha contracts \\\"may openly use\\\" riba interest rates such as LIBOR \\\"as a benchmark\\\", a practice approved of by the scholar Taqi Usmani. Conservative scholars promoting Islamic finance consider murabaha to be a \\\"transitory step\\\" towards a \\\"true profit-and-loss-sharing mode of financing\\\", and a \\\"weak\\\" or \\\"permissible but undesirable\\\" form of finance to be used where profit-and-loss-sharing is \\\"not practicable.\\\" Critics/skeptics complain/note that in practice most \\\"murabaḥah\\\" transactions are merely cash-flows between banks, brokers, and borrowers, with no buying or selling of commodities; that the profit or markup is based on the prevailing interest rate used in haram lending by the non-Muslim world; that \\\"the financial outlook\\\" of Islamic murabaha financing and conventional debt/loan financing is \\\"the same\\\", as is most everything else besides the terminology used.\\n&lt;human&gt;: What is meant by an Islamic bank loan\\n&lt;bot&gt;: According to Taqi Usmani \"in exceptional cases\" an Islamic bank or financial institution may lend cash to the customer for a murâbaḥah, but this is when the customer is acting as an \"agent\" of the bank in buying the good the customer needs financed.\\n&lt;human&gt;: more please\\n&lt;bot&gt;: [W]here direct purchase from the supplier is not practicable for some reason, it is also allowed that he makes the customer himself his agent to buy the commodity on his behalf.\\n&lt;human&gt;: In what form is the loan received?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: In this case the client first purchases the commodity on behalf of his financier and takes its possession as such.\\n&lt;human&gt;: What is the financier's role in the loan?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: Thereafter, he purchases the commodity from the financier for a deferred price.\\n&lt;human&gt;: What are the other modes of financing?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: The idea that the seller may not use murâbaḥah if profit-sharing modes of financing such as mudarabah or musharakah are practicable, is supported by other scholars that those in the Council of Islamic Ideology.\\n&lt;human&gt;: What are the differences between the modes?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: But these involve risks of loss, profit-sharing modes of financing cannot guarantee banks income.</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;context&gt;: Black Country Communion is an English-American hard rock band based in Los Angeles, California. Formed in 2009, the band is a supergroup composed of bassist and lead vocalist Glenn Hughes, guitarist and second vocalist Joe Bonamassa, drummer Jason Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian. Hughes and Bonamassa started the side project in November 2009 after an impromptu performance together. From the advice of their producer, Kevin Shirley, they recruited Bonham and Sherinian to finalize the band's lineup.\\nThe name Black Country Communion is derived from the term Black Country, which refers to an area of the West Midlands of England where Hughes and Bonham grew up. The group's sound is intentionally reminiscent of popular classic rock groups of the 1970s, reflecting the previous work of frontman Hughes (in bands such as Trapeze and Deep Purple) as well as the link between Bonham and his father John's band Led Zeppelin. After playing together for a while, the group released its self-titled debut album in 2010. Black Country Communion 2 followed the next year, which was promoted on the group's first concert tour of the US and Europe.\\nThe band released its third album, Afterglow, in 2012. In early 2013, after months of public tensions, Bonamassa announced he was no longer a member of Black Country Communion, with the question over whether the group would continue with another guitarist unclear. Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, while Hughes and Bonham formed California Breed with guitarist Andrew Watt. Hughes and Bonamassa later reconciled and the band reunited in late 2016, with a fourth album BCCIV released in 2017. After four years working on separate projects, the band plans to enter studio for a potential fifth album in late 2021.\\n&lt;human&gt;: What happened in 2010 with Black Country Communion?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: The band recorded its debut album at Los Angeles' Shangri-La Studios in early 2010, scheduling a September release through Mascot Records in Europe and Bonamassa's label J&amp;R Adventures in North America.\\n&lt;human&gt;: tell me more\\n&lt;bot&gt;: Hughes described the album as \"a big British rock statement\", comparing the band's sound to that of his previous groups Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, as well as Led Zeppelin.\\n&lt;human&gt;: Did they have any hit songs?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: \" One Last Soul\" was the first song to be released, receiving its worldwide debut on British digital radio station Planet Rock on August 2, 2010.\\n&lt;human&gt;: Did they release any other songs?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: The track was later released as a free digital download on the band's official website.\\n&lt;human&gt;: Did they have any problems?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: Shortly before the album's release, Planet Rock also broadcast an hour-long documentary featuring exclusive interviews with the band and a selection of tracks from the album.\\n&lt;human&gt;: What happened in 2011?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: \"Black Country Communion\" was officially released in Europe on September 20, 2010, and in North America a day later.</td>\n",

Completed in July 1942, she spent the majority of her career patrolling the waters off Norway in the North Sea, then was sent to the Pacific but was forced back due to technical problems. After three uneventful patrols in the North Sea, the boat conducted one patrol in the Bay of Biscay, attacking two surfaced German U-boats with torpedoes, but missed. The submarine then participated in Operation Source, an attempt to sink German battleships in Norway threatening allied Arctic convoys.\\nSea Nymph was assigned to tow the midget submarine X8 to off the fjord where the Tirpitz was anchored. While at sea, X8 was scuttled due to technical issues, and the mission was cancelled. The submarine was then tasked with transporting British agents to a fishing vessel off Norway. In her next two patrols, the boat fired torpedoes on three German merchant ships, but missed every attack.\\nIn March 1944, Sea Nymph was sent to the United States for a refit; she returned in October, then after an uneventful patrol, she had her battery changed. With Nazi Germany close to defeat, the submarine was ordered to the Pacific, where war with the Japanese was also ongoing. She had to turn back and have her battery replaced again after encountering problems; after arriving in the Philippines, on 13 July Sea Nymph caught on fire and was damaged beyond the repair capabilities of local shipyards. She was sent back to Great Britain, but as the war with Japan ended, she was not repaired but placed in reserve.

       "123288  <human>: Write me an article about Murabaḥah, ribh Arabic, Islamic jurisprudence, discussing in detail rent-to-own, agreed-upon in four paragraphs. End with a sentence about \" Critics/skeptics, the non-Muslim world.\\n<bot>: Murabaḥah, murabaḥa, or murâbaḥah (Arabic: مرابحة, derived from ribh Arabic: ربح, meaning profit) was originally a term of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) for a sales contract where the buyer and seller agree on the markup (profit) or \\\"cost-plus\\\" price for the item(s) being sold. In recent decades it has become a term for a very common form of Islamic (i.e., \\\"shariah compliant\\\") financing, where the price is marked up in exchange for allowing the buyer to pay over time—for example with monthly payments (a contract with deferred payment being known as bai-muajjal).\\nMurabaha financing is similar to a rent-to-own arrangement in the non-Muslim world, with the intermediary (e.g., the lending bank) retaining ownership of the item being sold until the loan is paid in full. There are also Islamic investment funds and sukuk (Islamic bonds) that use murabahah contracts.\\nThe purpose of murabaha is to finance a purchase without involving interest payments, which most Muslims (particularly most scholars) consider riba (usury) and thus haram (forbidden). Murabaha has come to be \\\"the most prevalent\\\" or \\\"default\\\" type of Islamic finance. A proper murâbaḥah transaction differs from conventional interest-charging loans in several ways. The buyer/borrower pays the seller/lender at an agreed-upon higher price; instead of interest charges, the seller/lender makes a religiously permissible \\\"profit on the sale of goods\\\".\\nThe seller/financer must take actual possession of the good before selling it to the customer, and must assume \\\"any liability from delivering defective goods\\\". Sources differ as to whether the seller is permitted to charge extra when payments are late, with some authors stating any late fees ought to be donated to charity, or not collected unless the buyer has \\\"deliberately refused\\\" to make a payment. For the rate of markup, murabaha contracts \\\"may openly use\\\" riba interest rates such as LIBOR \\\"as a benchmark\\\", a practice approved of by the scholar Taqi Usmani. Conservative scholars promoting Islamic finance consider murabaha to be a \\\"transitory step\\\" towards a \\\"true profit-and-loss-sharing mode of financing\\\", and a \\\"weak\\\" or \\\"permissible but undesirable\\\" form of finance to be used where profit-and-loss-sharing is \\\"not practicable.\\\" Critics/skeptics complain/note that in practice most \\\"murabaḥah\\\" transactions are merely cash-flows between banks, brokers, and borrowers, with no buying or selling of commodities; that the profit or markup is based on the prevailing interest rate used in haram lending by the non-Muslim world; that \\\"the financial outlook\\\" of Islamic murabaha financing and conventional debt/loan financing is \\\"the same\\\", as is most everything else besides the terminology used.\\n<human>: What is meant by an Islamic bank loan\\n<bot>: According to Taqi Usmani \"in exceptional cases\" an Islamic bank or financial institution may lend cash to the customer for a murâbaḥah, but this is when the customer is acting as an \"agent\" of the bank in buying the good the customer needs financed.\\n<human>: more please\\n<bot>: [W]here direct purchase from the supplier is not practicable for some reason, it is also allowed that he makes the customer himself his agent to buy the commodity on his behalf.\\n<human>: In what form is the loan received?\\n<bot>: In this case the client first purchases the commodity on behalf of his financier and takes its possession as such.\\n<human>: What is the financier's role in the loan?\\n<bot>: Thereafter, he purchases the commodity from the financier for a deferred price.\\n<human>: What are the other modes of financing?\\n<bot>: The idea that the seller may not use murâbaḥah if profit-sharing modes of financing such as mudarabah or musharakah are practicable, is supported by other scholars that those in the Council of Islamic Ideology.\\n<human>: What are the differences between the modes?\\n<bot>: But these involve risks of loss, profit-sharing modes of financing cannot guarantee banks income.   \n",
       "136897  <context>: Black Country Communion is an English-American hard rock band based in Los Angeles, California. Formed in 2009, the band is a supergroup composed of bassist and lead vocalist Glenn Hughes, guitarist and second vocalist Joe Bonamassa, drummer Jason Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian. Hughes and Bonamassa started the side project in November 2009 after an impromptu performance together. From the advice of their producer, Kevin Shirley, they recruited Bonham and Sherinian to finalize the band's lineup.\\nThe name Black Country Communion is derived from the term Black Country, which refers to an area of the West Midlands of England where Hughes and Bonham grew up. The group's sound is intentionally reminiscent of popular classic rock groups of the 1970s, reflecting the previous work of frontman Hughes (in bands such as Trapeze and Deep Purple) as well as the link between Bonham and his father John's band Led Zeppelin. After playing together for a while, the group released its self-titled debut album in 2010. Black Country Communion 2 followed the next year, which was promoted on the group's first concert tour of the US and Europe.\\nThe band released its third album, Afterglow, in 2012. In early 2013, after months of public tensions, Bonamassa announced he was no longer a member of Black Country Communion, with the question over whether the group would continue with another guitarist unclear. Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, while Hughes and Bonham formed California Breed with guitarist Andrew Watt. Hughes and Bonamassa later reconciled and the band reunited in late 2016, with a fourth album BCCIV released in 2017. After four years working on separate projects, the band plans to enter studio for a potential fifth album in late 2021.\\n<human>: What happened in 2010 with Black Country Communion?\\n<bot>: The band recorded its debut album at Los Angeles' Shangri-La Studios in early 2010, scheduling a September release through Mascot Records in Europe and Bonamassa's label J&R Adventures in North America.\\n<human>: tell me more\\n<bot>: Hughes described the album as \"a big British rock statement\", comparing the band's sound to that of his previous groups Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, as well as Led Zeppelin.\\n<human>: Did they have any hit songs?\\n<bot>: \" One Last Soul\" was the first song to be released, receiving its worldwide debut on British digital radio station Planet Rock on August 2, 2010.\\n<human>: Did they release any other songs?\\n<bot>: The track was later released as a free digital download on the band's official website.\\n<human>: Did they have any problems?\\n<bot>: Shortly before the album's release, Planet Rock also broadcast an hour-long documentary featuring exclusive interviews with the band and a selection of tracks from the album.\\n<human>: What happened in 2011?\\n<bot>: \"Black Country Communion\" was officially released in Europe on September 20, 2010, and in North America a day later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "205615  <context>: HMS Sea Nymph was a S-class submarine of the third batch built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Completed in July 1942, she spent the majority of her career patrolling the waters off Norway in the North Sea, then was sent to the Pacific but was forced back due to technical problems. After three uneventful patrols in the North Sea, the boat conducted one patrol in the Bay of Biscay, attacking two surfaced German U-boats with torpedoes, but missed. The submarine then participated in Operation Source, an attempt to sink German battleships in Norway threatening allied Arctic convoys.\\nSea Nymph was assigned to tow the midget submarine X8 to off the fjord where the Tirpitz was anchored. While at sea, X8 was scuttled due to technical issues, and the mission was cancelled. The submarine was then tasked with transporting British agents to a fishing vessel off Norway. In her next two patrols, the boat fired torpedoes on three German merchant ships, but missed every attack.\\nIn March 1944, Sea Nymph was sent to the United States for a refit; she returned in October, then after an uneventful patrol, she had her battery changed. With Nazi Germany close to defeat, the submarine was ordered to the Pacific, where war with the Japanese was also ongoing. She had to turn back and have her battery replaced again after encountering problems; after arriving in the Philippines, on 13 July Sea Nymph caught on fire and was damaged beyond the repair capabilities of local shipyards.

Now, the group in question organizes these sessions for tabletop games and the sessions are a very 'group only' sort of affair. A few months ago, I actually got invited to one and I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, I'm still a bit of an 'outsider'. On Wednesday, we have another session planned but the game that people want to play can only have six people and there are seven people invited including me. Several people have already commented how I'm not part of the 'core' group and that I shouldn't be invited at all. Should I just tell them I can't come to avoid the pain that is quite probably about to hit me? Should I just leave it and hope for the best?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: newbiee in a group, invited to a game, too many people invited for said game, may be ditched</td>\n",

A coworker improperly lifted a semi-trailer and it fell, crushing every bone in his right foot. When we visited last night, he was howling in pain while nurses kept running to get the resident to up his medications. \\n\\nThe company owner paid for his mom and other family to fly out to see him and paid for a hotel for them. He's having surgery right now to see if the foot can be saved. There's a potential for amputation. He's a huge football and sports player so the family is nervous. \\n\\nWhat can I do to show support? I'm wanting to make a big tray of muffins and pasta so that his visiting family can have something to eat. I'm sure they've been stressed to the point of improper nutrition. Other than that I'm not sure what I can do to make things a little easier. I've never experienced a family member having major surgery or illness. What should I be aware of during his recovery as well?\\n\\nCan you give me a shortened version of the text?\\n&lt;bot&gt;: Any tips on what you've done or what you've had family do for you to help after major surgery would be appreciated.</td>\n",

I wish i could do some drugs to just feel like i don't exist ..... I'm lonely, really fucking lonely.  I'm such a nice person but that's just fading away to just being an asshole.

Since then he's been single till now with just a few dates here and there.\\n\\nI'm sorta insecure since most my friends are males (due to my interests) and they tend to get told to not hang with me by their gfs when they get them. Its happened numerous times in the past. \\n\\nI have just shrugged it off in the past but K is my closest friend and the person other than my bf(dating for 4 years) that I hang out with the most.

I found a great job near my hometown after college that has been able to take care of us in a major way. She is younger than me so it took her an extra year to finish school.\\n\\nAfter graduating, she had no real ties to home so we found an apartment in a location that isn't either of our hometowns, but that would allow me to continue earning a solid living and taking care of our major expenses. About 2.5 months ago (and a week after we signed the lease), her mom suffered a major stroke from an AVM. She has always been a perfectly healthy woman so that came as quite a shock to us all.\\n\\nMy girlfriend is now stuck at home assisting her mother during her recovery and she has become the main caretaker at home. All of the plans that we had have been disrupted in a major way. Now, we are struggling every day to find any kind of optimism in our relationship and future together.\\n\\nI feel guilty for contuining (or attempting to continue) my life while she takes care of her family. She feels guilty for having plans to move out. I'm making a huge sacrifice by paying for all of our expenses and waiting for her, and she's now making a huge sacrifice in considering to move away from her family during their time of need.\\n\\nWhat possible future exists for us here?

       "18902   <human>: Can you give me the gist of the text in a nutshell?\\n\\nI just moved to a new school and I found a group that I really wanted to be a part of. Now, the group in question organizes these sessions for tabletop games and the sessions are a very 'group only' sort of affair. A few months ago, I actually got invited to one and I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, I'm still a bit of an 'outsider'. On Wednesday, we have another session planned but the game that people want to play can only have six people and there are seven people invited including me. Several people have already commented how I'm not part of the 'core' group and that I shouldn't be invited at all. Should I just tell them I can't come to avoid the pain that is quite probably about to hit me? Should I just leave it and hope for the best?\\n<bot>: newbiee in a group, invited to a game, too many people invited for said game, may be ditched                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "194250  <human>: My husbands cousin is a diesel mechanic and had an accident at work yesterday. A coworker improperly lifted a semi-trailer and it fell, crushing every bone in his right foot. When we visited last night, he was howling in pain while nurses kept running to get the resident to up his medications. \\n\\nThe company owner paid for his mom and other family to fly out to see him and paid for a hotel for them. He's having surgery right now to see if the foot can be saved. There's a potential for amputation. He's a huge football and sports player so the family is nervous. \\n\\nWhat can I do to show support? I'm wanting to make a big tray of muffins and pasta so that his visiting family can have something to eat. I'm sure they've been stressed to the point of improper nutrition. Other than that I'm not sure what I can do to make things a little easier. I've never experienced a family member having major surgery or illness. What should I be aware of during his recovery as well?\\n\\nCan you give me a shortened version of the text?\\n<bot>: Any tips on what you've done or what you've had family do for you to help after major surgery would be appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

I dont feel any real emotion anymore . I thought i had true love in my life but that only got me thrown in jail cuz she cheated on me and i broke some kids jaw.

I found a great job near my hometown after college that has been able to take care of us in a major way. She is younger than me so it took her an extra year to finish school.\\n\\nAfter graduating, she had no real ties to home so we found an apartment in a location that isn't either of our hometowns, but that would allow me to continue earning a solid living and taking care of our major expenses. About 2.5 months ago (and a week after we signed the lease), her mom suffered a major stroke from an AVM. She has always been a perfectly healthy woman so that came as quite a shock to us all.\\n\\nMy girlfriend is now stuck at home assisting her mother during her recovery and she has become the main caretaker at home. All of the plans that we had have been disrupted in a major way. Now, we are struggling every day to find any kind of optimism in our relationship and future together.\\n\\nI feel guilty for contuining (or attempting to continue) my life while she takes care of her family. She feels guilty for having plans to move out. I'm making a huge sacrifice by paying for all of our expenses and waiting for her, and she's now making a huge sacrifice in considering to move away from her family during their time of need.\\n\\nWhat possible future exists for us here? What would you do/how would you feel if you were either of us in our respective situations?\\n<bot>: My girlfriend's mother has been in the hospital after a major stroke and she lives 5.5 hours away taking care of her.
