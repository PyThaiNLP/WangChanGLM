# WangChanGLM üêò‚Ää-‚ÄäThe Thai-Turned-Multilingual Instruction-Following Model

[Blog]() | [Codes](https://github.com/pythainlp/wangchanglm) | [Demo]() 

WangChanGLM is a Thai-turned-multilingual, instruction-finetuned Facebook XGLM-7.5B using open-source, commercially permissible datasets (LAION OIG chip2 and infill_dbpedia, DataBricks Dolly v2, OpenAI TL;DR, and Hello-SimpleAI HC3; about 400k examples), released under CC-BY SA 4.0. The models are trained to perform a subset of instruction-following tasks we found most relevant namely: reading comprehension, brainstorming, and creative writing. We provide the weights for a model finetuned on an English-only dataset ([wangchanglm-7.5B-sft-en](https://huggingface.co/pythainlp/wangchanglm-7.5B-sft-en)) and another checkpoint further finetuned on Google-Translated Thai dataset ([wangchanglm-7.5B-sft-enth](https://huggingface.co/pythainlp/wangchanglm-7.5B-sft-enth)). We perform Vicuna-style evaluation using both humans and ChatGPT (in our case, `gpt-3.5-turbo` since we are still on the waitlist for `gpt-4`) and observe some discrepancies between the two types of annoators. All training and evaluation codes are shared under the [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/pythainlp/wangchanglm/blob/main/LICENSE) in our Github, as well as datasets and model weights on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/pythainlp). See our live demo [here]().

* [pythainlp/wangchanglm-7.5B-sft-enth-sharded](https://huggingface.co/pythainlp/wangchanglm-7.5B-sft-enth-sharded)

## Training Sets

We provide our training sets as follows:
* [pythainlp/final_training_set_v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pythainlp/final_training_set_v1)
* [pythainlp/final_training_set_v1_enth](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pythainlp/final_training_set_v1_enth)

## Finetuning

### Multi-world LoRA

We finetuned XGLM-7.5B on 4 V100 GPU (32GB VARM) with the hyperparameters described in `script/train_sft_peft_multi_world.py`.

```
python train_sft_peft_single_world.py \
--per_device_train_batch_size 2 --gradient_accumulation_steps 64 \ #effective batch size = 128 (1 GPU * 2 batch size * 64 gradient accumulation)
--wandb_project your_project_name \
--model_name facebook/xglm-7.5B \
--dataset_name pythainlp/final_training_set_v1 \ 
--adapter_name save_adapter_to
```

The adapter is merged to the main weights with the script from [lvwerra/trl](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/gpt-neox-20b_peft/merge_peft_adapter.py).

### Single-world LoRA

It is possible to finetune XGLM-7.5B on a single 32GB-VRAM GPU or multiple GPUs with a smaller VRAM with the hyperparameters described in `script/train_sft_peft_single_world.py`.

```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 train_sft_peft_multi_world.py \
--per_device_train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 32 \ #effective batch size = 128 (4 GPUs * 1 batch size * 32 gradient accumulation)
--wandb_project your_project_name \
--model_name facebook/xglm-7.5B \
--dataset_name pythainlp/final_training_set_v1 \ 
--adapter_name save_adapter_to
```

### Full-finetuning

We also provide a script for full finetuning we experimented with a smaller model on a different set of training data.

```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 train_sft.py \
--per_device_train_batch_size=8 --per_device_eval_batch_size=8 --gradient_accumulation_steps=16 \
--model_name=facebook/xglm-1.7B --bf16 --deepspeed=../config/sft_deepspeed_config.json
```

## Inference

We performed inference on the OpenAssistant prompts using hyperparameters described in `script/generate_huggingface_answer.py`.

```
python generate_huggingface_answer.py --input_fname ../data/oasst1_gpt35turbo_answer.csv \
--model_name pythainlp/wangchanglm-7.5B-sft-en \
--tokenizer_name pythainlp/wangchanglm-7.5B-sft-en \
--output_fname ../data/oasst1_wangchang_sft_en_only_answer_answer.csv 
```

## Evaluation

We evaluated any pair of model answers using `gpt-3.5-turbo` as described in `script/eval_vicuna_style.py`. The entire inference and evaluation is stored in `script/infer_and_eval.sh`. The human questionnaires are stored in `data/human_questionnaire`.

## Environmental Impact

Experiments were conducted using a private infrastructure, which has a carbon efficiency of 0.432 kgCO2eq/kWh. A cumulative of 500 hours of computation was performed on hardware of type Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB (TDP of 300W). Total emissions are estimated to be 64.8 CO2eq of which 0 percents were directly offset. Estimations were conducted using the [MachineLearning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [lacoste2019quantifying](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).
